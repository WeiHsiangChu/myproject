ðŸ“„ [Read Full Report (PDF)](antenna-project.pdf)

This undergraduate project presents a low-profile PIFA antenna design for narrow-bezel laptops.  
The antenna operates in both 2.4 GHz and Wi-Fi 6E bands and is optimized using HFSS simulations.

## ðŸ“Œ Highlights
- Frequency bands: 2400â€“2484 MHz & 5150â€“7125 MHz
- Antenna type: PIFA (Planar Inverted-F Antenna)
- Substrate: FR4, 0.4 mm thickness
- Gain: up to 4.08 dBi; Efficiency: up to 89%
- Designed for metal enclosure and 4 mm max height
