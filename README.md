# Wei-Hsiang Chu's Project Portfolio

This repository contains selected works from my undergraduate and graduate studies in Electrical and Computer Engineering, ranging from antenna design to AI and reinforcement learning projects.

## ðŸ”¹ Undergraduate Projects
- **[Low-Profile Laptop Antenna for Wi-Fi 6E](undergraduate/antenna-design)**  
  Designed a PIFA antenna for use in narrow-bezel laptops, optimized for the Wi-Fi 6E band.

## ðŸ”¸ Graduate Projects
- **[Arrhythmia Detection using PPG and Machine Learning](graduate/arrhythmia-ml)**  
  Applied supervised learning techniques to detect early signs of arrhythmia from physiological signals.

- **[ATE Drift Prediction using Reinforcement Learning](graduate/ATE-drift-RL)**  
  Simulated an ATE environment and trained agents to predict equipment drift using Double Q-Learning.

## ðŸ“Œ About Me
M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at UC Davis  
Interested in AI for embedded systems, wireless communication, and applied research.
